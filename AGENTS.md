# TRUST-ROBOT Agent Entry Point

Before making any project change, read:

1. `TRUST_ROBOT_MASTER_CONTEXT.md`
2. the TRUST-ROBOT research proposal
3. `README.md`
4. relevant inherited documentation under `docs/`

The current repository was inherited from the RC-RGD-IMU project as a working
research-pipeline scaffold.

Do not assume inherited IMU-HAR scientific choices are valid for TRUST-ROBOT.

The new scientific target is reliability-aware multimodal 6-DoF
localization/state estimation with calibrated modality-health probabilities,
auxiliary consistency evidence, health-aware factor weighting, estimator
status, and rule-based safety supervision.

Work incrementally. Preserve reproducibility, train/validation/test isolation,
protocol freezing, experiment provenance, and independent reference-source
rules.

See `TRUST_ROBOT_MASTER_CONTEXT.md` for the authoritative project context.
